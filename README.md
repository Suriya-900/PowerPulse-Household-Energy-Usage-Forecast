# PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast

# ‚ö° Energy Consumption Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict **Global Active Power Consumption** using historical energy usage data and various machine learning regression models. The dataset is based on real-time measurements of power and sub-metering collected from a household.

## üìå Project Highlights

- Time-based feature engineering (hour, day, weekday, peak hours)
- Rolling statistics: rolling mean (15 min, 1 hour), daily average
- Multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) on Random Forest
- Performance comparison via metrics and visualizations
- Residual analysis to evaluate model fit

## Correlation Heatmap
High correlation between Global_active_power and:

Sub_metering_3 (0.64)

Global_intensity (0.63)

Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2

Voltage shows weak or negative correlations, indicating it's less impactful on its own.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Used

- Temporal features: `hour`, `day`, `month`, `weekday`, `is_peak_hour`
- Electrical measurements: `Voltage`, `Global_reactive_power`, `Global_intensity`
- Sub-metering: `Sub_metering_1`, `Sub_metering_2`, `Sub_metering_3`
- Rolling statistics: `rolling_mean`, `rolling_mean_1hr`, `daily_avg_power`

##üåø How This Helps Households Save Energy


1. Personalized Energy Planning:

Predict usage trends and optimize appliance use timing.

2. Anomaly Detection:

Spot sudden spikes indicating broken or inefficient appliances.

3. Smart Home Integration:

Automate actions like turning off high-consumption devices during peak hours.

4. Environmental Impact:

Reduced energy waste = Lower carbon emissions


‚úÖ Interpretation:
Random Forest is the best overall (lowest RMSE & MAE, highest R¬≤).

XGBoost is close behind.

Linear Regression performs well but less precise than ensemble methods.
